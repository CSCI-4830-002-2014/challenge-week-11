# How many points have you earned?

95/100

(Make your own calculation and replace the number 0 with the points you think you've earned.)

# How many hours have you spent on this?

2.5

# When did you first start working on this week's learning challenges?

Saturday

# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

CSV to JSON. Not difficult, just time consuming to figure it out.
Also, too many screen shots required again. When proving that you did a task takes longer than the task itself, that's an issue.
I also didn't think doing Mongo Challenge 4 was worth it. Too much for only 5 points.
