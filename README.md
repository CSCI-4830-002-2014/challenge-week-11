# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

Prepping the data for mongo was WAY harder than anything else in this assignment.  I spent so much time trying to get the datasets in the format
required.  Especially since we used 3 datasets instead of just working with one once we had it figured out.

This seemed to break when I gave it anything but normal or kernel. I'm not sure why..
