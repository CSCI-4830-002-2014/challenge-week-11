# When did you first start working on this week's learning challenges?

Thursday

# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

Getting the mongoDB to corrrectly accept my JSON. After 3 hours and no clue where to try next, I gave up.

# Graph Database I

Couldn't get the toolboxes for knnclassify and svmtrain without paying.

### 2. (5 point)
